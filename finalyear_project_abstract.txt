The project focuses on preventing Sybil attacks in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) by combining Blomâ€™s Scheme for key distribution with collaborative trust mechanisms.
It aims to authenticate vehicle identities using advanced cryptography and trust models, incorporating key signals like location and proximity. 
The framework will analyze performance metrics, including false positives and communication overhead, to ensure real-time attack detection and improve vehicular network security for safer transportation systems.
